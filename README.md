# RP2040 FM Transmitter

**Version 0.24.0** — MicroPython USB sound card + FM transmitter

[中文](README.zh.md) · English · [Project](https://git.sr.ht/~bytewolf/rp2040-fm-transmitter)

Turn a Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) into a **USB sound card + FM transmitter**:

- Plugged into a PC it enumerates as a USB sound card (UAC1, 48kHz/16-bit/stereo);
  whatever the PC plays is streamed to the Pico over USB;
- The audio is FM-modulated in real time onto **87.9 MHz** (configurable:
  broadcast FM 88-108M, 2m amateur 144-148M, and UHF 409/433/440M via the
  3rd/5th harmonic of a <=150MHz fundamental) using the
  [pico-fractional-pll](https://github.com/kaduhi/pico-fractional-pll)
  technique, output on GPIO21;
- MicroPython provides an interactive **`fm>` serial console**: carrier /
  deviation / power / pre-emphasis / volume controls, a live level bar, and
  PLL diagnostics.

> **⚠️ LEGAL WARNING**: GPIO21 drives a strong RF square wave. **Do NOT attach
> an antenna.** Unlicensed radiation is illegal in most countries. For testing,
> put an FM radio within a few centimetres of the Pico.  On the UHF harmonic
> bands the *fundamental* also radiates: for 409MHz it sits in the AERONAUTICAL
> band (118-137MHz) - a band-pass filter is mandatory before radiating there.

## Quick start

1. Flash `firmware/rp2040pico_fm_firmware.uf2` (BOOTSEL drag & drop, or
   `tools/flash.sh`);
2. Upload the console script:
   ```
   tools/upload.sh
   ```
   (This handles the FM console holding the REPL - a plain `mpremote cp`
   fails with "could not enter raw repl".  Equivalent manual steps: in a
   serial terminal type `exit` at the `fm>` prompt, then
   `mpremote resume fs cp python/main.py :main.py`.)
3. Replug (or press RESET), wait 2-3 s, open a serial terminal (115200) — the
   `fm>` console appears automatically;
4. On the PC select **"RP2040 RF Transmitter"** as the audio output and play;
5. Tune an FM radio to **87.9 MHz**.

One-command band presets (save + reboot):

```
band fm    -> 98.0 MHz FM broadcast (parked-carrier silence)
band 2m    -> 145.0 MHz, handheld radio VHF WIDE mode
band 433   -> 433.92 MHz on the 3rd harmonic (UHF WIDE mode)
band 409   -> 409.75 MHz license-free PMR on the 3rd harmonic
```

For a handheld radio use **WIDE (25kHz)** mode and keep the deviation around
12kHz; the console sets `refdiv 2` automatically on every band that keys the RF
off when silent (the half PDM step is what makes the harmonic links sound
clean).  Broadcast FM keeps `refdiv 1` because a parked carrier with refdiv 2
has an audible idle tone.  When there is no audio the
narrowband bands key the RF output off (PTT-style) so the handheld squelch
closes instead of hearing an off-tune parked carrier - use `silence park` to
restore the broadcast behaviour.  For a serial session that survives reboots:
`tools/serial.sh` (tio auto-reconnect; a udev rule pins `/dev/pico`).

## Build from source

```bash
git clone git@git.sr.ht:~bytewolf/rp2040-fm-transmitter
cd rp2040-fm-transmitter
./build.sh            # default MicroPython v1.29.0
# or ./build.sh <tag-or-commit>
```
The script clones a clean MicroPython, applies the patch, fetches submodules
and builds; the artifact lands in `firmware/`. It is fully automated — one
command produces the UF2 and its `sha256.txt`. Details in
[docs/en/technical.md](docs/en/technical.md).

**Prerequisites (Ubuntu/Debian)** — the host needs the RP2040 cross-toolchain
before running `build.sh`:

```bash
sudo apt install -y build-essential git cmake \
    gcc-arm-none-eabi libnewlib-arm-none-eabi \
    libstdc++-arm-none-eabi-newlib python3
```

`mpremote` (upload `main.py`) and `picotool` (`tools/flash.sh`) are optional
and only needed for uploading/flashing. See
[docs/en/technical.md](docs/en/technical.md) for details.

## Credits & licences

- [MicroPython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython) (MIT) — our changes
  are shipped as a patch;
- [pico-fractional-pll](https://github.com/kaduhi/pico-fractional-pll)
  (BSD-3-Clause, Kazuhisa Terasaki) — **its core source is incorporated into
  our patch** (`ports/rp2/fm_transmitter/pico_fractional_pll.c/.h`); keep the
  attribution; it is not a separate build dependency;
- [kaduhi/pico-playground (fm_transmitter branch)](https://github.com/kaduhi/pico-playground)
  — **reference only** (UAC1 descriptors and FM modulation ideas); no code
  from it is included;
- This project: see [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Dependencies & build sources

The build depends only on **MicroPython** (with its own submodules
pico-sdk/tinyusb/mbedtls). `build.sh` tries these sources in order:
1. `https://git.sr.ht/~bytewolf/micropython` (maintainer's fork, for
   availability);
2. `https://github.com/micropython/micropython` (upstream).

> On "why not a git submodule": for this project the **patch + clone script**
> fits better — MicroPython is large with its own nested submodules, so a
> top-level submodule still needs recursive init; a patch keeps "what we
> changed" visible, applies to any version/fork, and does not pin the project
> to one fork's maintenance cadence. If you prefer submodules, apply the patch
> inside your fork and reference it with `git clone --recurse-submodules`;
> build.sh already skips the patch when it is already applied.
