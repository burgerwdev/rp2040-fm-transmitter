# RP2040 RF Transmitter console for the RPI_PICO_FM MicroPython firmware.
#
# Starts the transmitter, then provides an interactive serial console.
# Connect with a serial terminal (screen/minicom/PuTTY on the CDC port,
# 115200 baud) or run from Thonny.  Type `help` for the command list.
#
# Carrier/deviation can be persisted: `reinit` saves them to /fm_cfg.json and
# reboots, so the new values are used on every boot.
#
# WARNING: GPIO21 outputs a strong RF signal. Do NOT attach an antenna wire;
# radiating from this pin is most likely illegal in your country.
