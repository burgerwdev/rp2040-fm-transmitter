# FM transmit audio-quality layer audit

> [中文](../zh/audio-quality.md) · English

This document audits, layer by layer, the code in this repository that affects
the **received** sound quality, and gives quantified limits plus an impact
ranking. Every number comes from the host-side script
`tools/audio_quality.py`, a line-by-line replica of the fixed-point semantics
and coefficient constants of `fm_modulator.c: fm_audio_process()`.

> **This analysis does not flash the board and does not measure hardware.**
> Every number below is reproducible on the host with:
> ```bash
> python3 tools/audio_quality.py resp
> python3 tools/audio_quality.py thd
> python3 tools/audio_quality.py limiter
> python3 tools/audio_quality.py drift
> ```

## 1. Layers and impact ranking

| Layer | Location | Limit | Audible effect | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **L3 audio DSP chain** | `fm_modulator.c: fm_audio_process()` | non-standard pre-emphasis (+8.6 dB too much at 2 kHz, −6.3 dB too little at 15 kHz); two first-order band-limit poles (−2.2 dB at 10 kHz); no limiter look-ahead | **tonal error (midrange hump, dull top) + severe distortion on loud material (THD 18–26 %)** | **P0** |
| **L1 USB audio & asynchronous sample clock** | `shared/tinyusb/*`, `tud_audio_rx_done_isr()` | host 48 kHz and PWM 48 kHz come from two independent crystals; no resampler, no feedback endpoint, no drift counter | periodic clicks after long playback (starts after ~14 min and persists) | **P1** |
| **L5 PLL/PDM RF layer** | `pico_fractional_pll.c` | the instantaneous frequency dithers by `ref/div` at 1 MHz; the PLL loop filter averages it only partially | RF phase noise / receiver noise floor (worst on narrowband and weak signals) | **P1** |
| **L2 mono mix & ring buffer** | `tud_audio_rx_done_isr()`, `fm_pwm_wrap_handler()` | the mix itself is clean (no int32 overflow; anti-phase cancellation is inherent to mono); the ring has no drop/underflow counters and zeroes instead of holding | the mix is inaudible (−91.8 dBFS truncation); the ring hides L1 and turns a drop into a dropout | **P2** |
| **L6 USB control surface & defaults** | `fm_modulator.c: fm_db256_to_gain()`, `main.py` | UAC1 volume maps **dB → linear gain** linearly, not dB → dB | volume slider is mis-calibrated (request −30 dB, get −6 dB) | **P2** |
| **L4 modulation mapping** | `fm_pwm_wrap_handler()` | `freq = carrier + (sample*dev)>>15` | none (0.99997× full deviation; negligible) | — |

Rationale: L3 decides the tone and distortion and is 100 % verifiable on the
host; L1/L5 decide long-listen and weak-signal usability; L2/L6 are correctness
and observability.

## 2. Layer-by-layer audit

### L3 audio DSP chain (P0)

With pre-emphasis on, the chain is: `2 Hz DC block → first-order 15 kHz LP →
pre-emphasis → first-order 15 kHz LP → 2:1 soft-knee limiter`.

**Defect 1: the pre-emphasis curve is not the standard one.** The code computes
`y = lp15 + (lp15 - lp75)*5`, i.e. a **shelf with a +14 dB ceiling**
(20·log10(5)) that starts bending around 1 kHz. Standard 75 µs pre-emphasis is
a +6 dB/octave rise, referenced to 0 dB at 2.12 kHz, reaching +17.0 dB at
15 kHz.

```
  f (Hz)  75us     (measured transmit response, dB)
  1000    7.75
  2000    11.33
  5000    13.20
  15000   10.80

  Net received response = transmit response - standard receiver de-emphasis
  (what the listener actually hears)
  f (Hz)     75us net
  1000           6.88
  2000           8.57
  5000           5.04
  10000         -1.44
  15000         -6.27
```

**Result: the listener hears a +8.6 dB midrange hump around 2 kHz and a −6.3 dB
collapse at 15 kHz.** This is not "pre-emphasis is off"; the *shape* is wrong.
Turning pre-emphasis off only makes the top end duller, because the receiver's
de-emphasis is a fixed −6 dB/octave.

**Defect 2: the pre-emphasis burns 7–8 dB of headroom.** Because 1 kHz is
already boosted by 7.75 dB:

```
  tone    level      preemph 75   preemph off  clips(75us)
  1000    loud          17.859 %      0.002 %        0
  5000    loud          25.945 %      0.000 %        0
  1000    linear         0.033 %      0.013 %        0
```

`loud` is a sine of amplitude 20000 (≈ −4 dBFS). The standard 75 µs curve has
only +0.87 dB at 1 kHz, so the same input would not reach the limiter. **The
distortion is therefore caused by the wrong pre-emphasis curve, not by the
limiter itself.**

**Defect 3: the band-limit is only two first-order poles.**

```
  f (Hz)  lp2only   (band-limit only, dB)
  5000     -0.66
  10000    -2.16
  15000    -3.67
  23000    -4.89
```

The passband is already 2.2 dB down at 10 kHz and 3.7 dB down at 15 kHz (large
for a 15 kHz broadcast band); the stopband at 23 kHz is only −4.9 dB, i.e. the
48 kHz sampling images are barely suppressed.

**Defect 4: disabling pre-emphasis also removes the band-limit.** The
`if (!s_preemphasis_enabled)` branch `return x` without any low-pass in
wideband mode; only narrowband keeps its 3 kHz low-pass. See the flat `off`
column above.

**Defect 5: no limiter look-ahead.** On a step input, 200 samples sit above the
soft knee:

```
  step 0->30000 [+pre]   overshoot=200 samples above knee, clips=0
```

(The soft knee is intentional programme processing and need not change, but it
amplifies defect 2.)

### L1 USB audio & asynchronous sample clock (P1)

- descriptor: UAC1, 48 kHz, 16-bit, stereo, `wMaxPacketSize=192`,
  `bInterval=1`;
- `CFG_TUD_AUDIO_ENABLE_FEEDBACK_EP = 0`: **no feedback endpoint**, so the host
  free-runs 48000 samples/s off its own crystal;
- the consumer is PWM slice 7, `48 MHz / 1000`, derived from the RP2040's
  12 MHz crystal;
- there is **no asynchronous sample-rate conversion (ASRC)** between them;
  the drift counters were added in change 4 (§4).

```
  ppm    time to hit    glitch rate      glitches in 600s
         the limit      (samples/s)
  -100   427 s          4.80             832
  -50    853 s          2.40             0
  -25    1707 s         1.20             0
  100    427 s          4.80             832

  Ring depth = 4096 samples = 85.3 ms of buffering
```

Typical crystal errors of 10–50 ppm mean the buffer **saturates after roughly
14–28 minutes, then drops/underflows continuously at 0.5–2.4 events/s** (each
one a sample-level discontinuity = a light click). Two free-running crystals
never re-align themselves, so this is a "guaranteed after a while" problem.

### L5 PLL/PDM RF layer (P1)

The audio DSP decides *what* is sent; this layer decides *how clean* the
emission is. The instantaneous frequency dithers by `step = ref/div` on the
1 MHz PDM tick, and the PLL loop filter only partly averages it:

```
$ python3 tools/pll_range.py check 87900000 75000 1
... div=16 ... PDM step=750.000 kHz
$ python3 tools/pll_range.py check 87900000 75000 2
... div=16 ... PDM step=375.000 kHz
$ python3 tools/pll_range.py check 7074000 3000 1
... div=150 ... PDM step=80.000 kHz
$ python3 tools/pll_range.py check 7074000 3000 2
... div=200 ... PDM step=30.000 kHz
```

`refdiv 2` halves the step on **every** band, but `main.py` only set
`refdiv 2` for targets above 150 MHz (UHF harmonics). Note that the host
cannot compute the **residual** ripple after loop filtering (that needs the
loop bandwidth and a phase-noise measurement), so only the computable step is
given here; the residual is left to hardware measurement.

→ **fixed by change 5 (§4)**: replaced by a data-driven rule plus the new
`refdiv auto`.

### L2 mono mix & ring buffer (P2; the buffer half is fixed by change 4 in §4)

**The mix half: audited, clean, no change warranted.**
`tud_audio_rx_done_isr()` first computes
`mono = ((int32_t)frame[0] + frame[1]) >> 1`, then `mono = (mono * volume) >> 15`:

```
$ python3 tools/audio_quality.py mono
    L=R=30000  -> 29999  (unity for correlated content)
    L=+30000 R=-30000 -> 0  (anti-phase cancels: inherent to a mono mix)
  volume     mean err (LSB) rms err (LSB)  equiv. noise floor
  0 dB       -0.750         0.841          -91.8 dBFS
  -6 dB      -0.376         0.469          -96.9 dBFS
  -40 dB     -0.502         0.579          -95.1 dBFS
```

- the int32 sum is halved, so it cannot overflow; correlated content is 1:1 and
  no gain error is introduced;
- the only artefact is truncating instead of rounding: at unity volume the mix
  floor (−0.25 LSB mean) and the volume floor add up to −0.75 LSB mean /
  0.84 LSB rms = **−91.8 dBFS**, about 9 dB above an ideal rounder
  (0.289 LSB rms = −101.1 dBFS) and far below any audible threshold; its DC
  part is removed by the 2 Hz DC blocker. No rounding logic is added for it.

**The ring-buffer half: state before the fix.**

- on an empty ring `fm_pwm_wrap_handler()` sets `s_cur_sample = 0` → the
  carrier parks on fc for that tick (a dropout) instead of holding the last
  sample;
- on a full ring the host sample is dropped silently (the code comments say so);
- **neither event increments any counter**; `diag` exposes only `ISR ticks` and
  `RX frames`, so L1's drift is invisible.

### L6 USB control surface & defaults (P2)

`fm_db256_to_gain()` maps the UAC1 dB value **linearly** to a linear gain:

```c
return (uint16_t)(((clamped - FM_VOL_MIN) * 32767) / (FM_VOL_MAX - FM_VOL_MIN));
```

so `gain_lin = (db + 60) / 60` and the actual attenuation is
`20·log10((db+60)/60)`:

| requested (dB) | actual (dB) | error |
|---|---|---|
| −6 | −0.92 | +5.1 |
| −12 | −1.94 | +10.1 |
| −20 | −3.52 | +16.5 |
| −30 | −6.02 | +24.0 |
| −40 | −9.54 | +30.5 |
| −50 | −15.56 | +34.4 |
| −60 | −∞ | — |

i.e. only the top ~10 dB of the volume slider is accurate.

→ **fixed by change 6 (§4)**.

The other defaults (`DEFAULT_PREEMPH="on"(75us)`, `DEFAULT_SQUELCH=0`,
`DEFAULT_CARRIER=87.9 MHz`) are reasonable in themselves; the `refdiv` choice
rule is covered in L5.

### L4 modulation mapping (negligible)

`freq = s_carrier_hz + ((int64_t)sample * deviation) >> 15`: full-scale ±32767
gives 0.99997× deviation and 0 gives an exactly parked carrier — both
intentional and correct. FM needs no pre-integration of the audio. 48 kHz
sampling gives 3.2× oversampling for a 15 kHz audio band, which is enough.

## 4. Implemented changes and before/after data (host side)

All three changes stay inside the fixed-point path of `fm_modulator.c` (no
division, no floating point); `python3 tools/audio_quality.py compare`
reproduces the tables below exactly. The patch was regenerated
(`patches/micropython-fm.patch`) and **compiles** (`make BOARD=RPI_PICO_FM`;
compile only, nothing was flashed).

### Change 1: standard pre-emphasis curve

- old: `y = lp15 + (lp15-lp75)*5` — a fixed +14 dB shelf
- new: first difference `y = x + G*(x-x[n-1])` with `G = tau*fs` (Q10):
  75 µs → 3686, 50 µs → 2458, 300 µs → 14746
- semantics: disabling pre-emphasis no longer removes the band-limit (the old
  code had no low-pass at all on the wideband + disabled path)

```

```

### Change 2: fourth-order Chebyshev band-limit (15 kHz)

The coefficients are generated by `tools/design_filters.py` (Chebyshev I,
0.2 dB ripple, fc = 15 kHz, two second-order sections, Q15). The script also
verifies the quantised response error (< 0.05 dB) and the peak internal state
at full scale (~3.3e4, far below int32). The narrowband path moves to a
second-order section at 3.4 kHz.

### Change 3: fixed-point overflow safety

The biquad input and feedback term are bounded to int16 range so the largest
product is `|b1|*32767 = 1.32e9 < 2^31`. (Without the bound, full-scale
broadband noise rings a section's state to ~1e5 and `a1*y = 2.5e9` overflows
int32 = undefined behaviour.) Saturation only happens where the signal is
already several times full scale and about to be hard-clipped by the limiter;
the unsaturated y is still returned to the limiter, so the `clips` counter
keeps working.

### Change 4: hold-last on underflow + drop/underflow counters (L1/L2)

- `fm_modulator.c`: an empty ring no longer always zeroes the sample. While
  the host is streaming (`s_audio_active`) and the empty run is shorter than
  480 ticks (10 ms), the previous sample is repeated (hold-last) and counted
  in `s_ring_underflows`. A longer empty run means the host really stopped, so
  the carrier still parks on fc (the original "host paused = exactly on fc"
  behaviour is preserved).
- a full ring now increments the new `s_ring_drops` (it used to be a silent
  drop).
- exposed as `pico_fm.ring_stats() -> (underflows, drops)`; `diag` and
  `status` print them (on older firmware `diag` says the interface is
  missing).

```
Asynchronous sample-clock drift (same counters; policy-independent)

  50     853 s          2.40             0 / 0

  50       7053             27591                0.035%    0.008%
  100      7053             27591                0.064%    0.012%
  clean    5898             -                        -    0.007%
```

The event *count* is identical (the counter proves the drift happens), but
after the change each event no longer produces a 4-5x larger step and the
THD returns to the drift-free value.

Note: the counters only make the drift *visible*, they do not correct it;
hold-last removes the click, not the timing error. A real fix is an ASRC or a
UAC1 feedback endpoint (see the upgrade path below).

### Change 5: refdiv policy and console defaults (L5)

- new `refdiv_for(target)`: **1 where the carrier is parked, 2 everywhere
  else.**  Broadcast FM (87.5–108 MHz) parks the unmodulated carrier when
  silent, and refdiv 2 changes the parked PDM pattern and puts an audible idle
  tone on the silent carrier (hardware-observed: the v0.22.x FM silence
  regression), so it must stay 1. 2m/UHF/narrowband-HF key the RF off when
  silent, so there is no parked carrier and they take 2.
- `band_apply()`, the `band` command and boot-time `apply_config()` all use the
  helper now (they used to test `target > 150 MHz` only); the console gained
  `refdiv <1|2|auto>` with auto as the default, and an explicit 1/2 in the
  config still wins.
- if the refdiv-2 window is unsolvable at boot, init automatically falls back
  to refdiv 1 (a failed `init` never launches core1, so the retry is safe) and
  persists the 1.
- `status` now shows the actual PDM step (the width of the window
  `pico_fm.range()` returns is exactly one feedback-divider step).

```
$ python3 tools/pll_range.py minstep 1800000 30000000 50000 3000 --refdiv 2
  windows with a solution: 559, without: 6
  first-found is NOT the minimum step in 0 window(s)
$ python3 tools/pll_range.py minstep 80000000 500000000 500000 5000 --refdiv 2
  windows with a solution: 129, without: 712
  first-found is NOT the minimum step in 0 window(s)
```

The solution the C `calculate_pll_divider()` returns already has the smallest
step within its pass, so the search needs no change (verification instead of
speculation).

| Band | step before | step after |
|---|---|---|
| FM 98.0 MHz (parked) | 750 kHz (refdiv 1) | 750 kHz (stays 1, avoids the idle tone) |
| 2m 145.0 MHz | 1.2 MHz (refdiv 1) | **600 kHz** (refdiv 2) |
| 433.92 MHz (x3) | 600 kHz (refdiv 2) | 600 kHz (unchanged) |
| 30m 10.136 MHz | 80 kHz (refdiv 1) | **40 kHz** (refdiv 2) |
| 20m 14.074 MHz | 120 kHz | **60 kHz** |
| 10m 28.074 MHz | 240 kHz | **120 kHz** |

### Change 6: real dB mapping for the UAC1 volume (L6)

- new `fm_vol_table[61]` (one `round(32767*10^(dB/20))` per dB from 0 to
  -60 dB); `fm_db256_to_gain()` interpolates between whole dB and the
  1/256 dB remainder, and `fm_gain_to_db256()` searches the monotonic table
  (exact round trip).
- only the two fixed-point helpers change; neither is on the ISR path and
  there is no floating point.

| requested (dB) | actual before | error before | actual after | error after |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| −6 | −0.92 | +5.08 | −6.00 | −0.00 |
| −12 | −1.94 | +10.06 | −12.00 | +0.00 |
| −20 | −3.52 | +16.48 | −20.00 | +0.00 |
| −30 | −6.02 | +23.98 | −30.00 | −0.00 |
| −40 | −9.54 | +30.46 | −39.99 | +0.01 |
| −60 | −∞ | — | −59.94 | +0.06 |

Worst interpolation error: 0.015 dB over 0…−30 dB, 0.26 dB over the whole
range (at −60 dB, i.e. already 60 dB of attenuation).

### Before/after (`audio_quality.py compare`)

| Metric | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| net received response at 1 kHz | +6.88 dB | **+0.22 dB** |
| net received response at 15 kHz | −6.27 dB | **−0.37 dB** |
| worst error in 0.3–15 kHz | 6.88 dB | **0.91 dB** |
| 14 kHz passband droop | 3.39 dB | **0.15 dB** |
| 23 kHz stopband | −4.89 dB | **−79.25 dB** |
| 1 kHz loud-level THD | 17.86 % | **0.008 %** |
| 10 kHz full-scale THD | 0.76 % | **0.000 %** |
| band-limit with pre-emphasis off | none (0.00 dB) | 20 kHz −34.7 dB |
| worst step on an underflow | 27591 | **7053** |
| THD during underflows | 0.035 % | **0.008 %** |
| drop/underflow observability | no counters | `pico_fm.ring_stats()` |
| 2m PDM dither step | 1.2 MHz | **600 kHz** |
| 30m PDM dither step | 80 kHz | **40 kHz** |
| refdiv selection | `target > 150 MHz` only | **`refdiv_for()` + `refdiv auto`** |
| actual attenuation for a −30 dB request | −6.0 dB (error +24 dB) | **−30.0 dB (error 0)** |

## 5. Remaining work

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| L1/L2: hold-last + drop/underflow counters | **done (change 4)**; residual: no ASRC / feedback endpoint, so the drift still exists |
| L5: refdiv policy + `refdiv auto` | **done (change 5)**; residual: the **residual** ripple after loop filtering still needs hardware measurement |
| L6: real dB mapping for the UAC1 volume | **done (change 6)** (worst interpolation error 0.26 dB, 0.015 dB over 0…−30 dB) |
| limiter look-ahead | not implemented (gain is programme-dependent; change 1 already removed the main pseudo-distortion source) |
| ASRC / UAC1 feedback endpoint | not implemented (needs ISR budget or TinyUSB feedback support; a structural change) |

## 6. Out of scope

- **Stereo MPX (19 kHz pilot + 38 kHz DSB)**: at 48 kHz sampling it needs 4×
  interpolation (192 kHz), while the current ISR already costs 2–6 µs/sample;
  4× is 40–115 % CPU. It is a separate project requiring a sampling-clock
  redesign.
- **AM/SSB/DRM**: this chain is a fixed-amplitude square wave with frequency-only
  modulation; they need an external linear modulator stage.
- **RF measurements** (phase noise, residual ripple, real received audio): this
  goal explicitly excludes hardware measurement; the "residual ripple" in item 5
  above can only be settled by measurement.

---

## 7. Regression verification

**Build (`./build.sh`, clean clone)**

```
$ ./build.sh
==> Building RPI_PICO_FM firmware, MicroPython ref: v1.29.0
    trying https://git.sr.ht/~bytewolf/micropython ...
    patch applied
    source: https://git.sr.ht/~bytewolf/micropython
[100%] Built target firmware
==> Done: firmware/rp2040pico_fm_firmware.uf2
   FLASH 350180 B / 640 KB (53.43%), RAM 36812 B / 256 KB (14.04%)
```

- `./build.sh` completed end-to-end on a **clean clone** (clone → apply patch →
  `make submodules` → build); the resulting UF2 has sha256
  `810e9e0bd8599ef11051de81aa9a65a28e35ca4b39bf30caf9983b11f6018ebb`, and that
  is what `firmware/rp2040pico_fm_firmware.uf2` holds (`sha256sum -c
  firmware/sha256.txt` passes and `python/main.py`'s `FW_SHA256` matches).
- **Patch round-trip**: regenerating the patch after applying
  `patches/micropython-fm.patch` to a clean MicroPython gives **0 diff** against
  the committed patch, i.e. the patch is self-consistent and reproduces this
  build exactly.

**Hardware validation (v0.24.0, 98.0 MHz FM broadcast, host streaming)**

| Item | Measured | Cross-check |
|---|---|---|
| `ver` | sha `810e9e0b…` | matches the shipped firmware |
| `status` | `PLL range 97.500..98.250 MHz`, `step 750.0 kHz`, `refdiv 1` | matches `pll_range.py check 98000000 75000 1 -> div=16` bit for bit |
| `diag 30` | ISR +1440230, RX +1440192, Underflows +39, Drops 0 | two independent estimates: 27.1 ppm from the event count, 26.4 ppm from the counter difference; predicted event rate 1.28/s vs 1.3/s measured |
| `Clips` | 0 | the reworked pre-emphasis leaves ample headroom |

The host 48 kHz clock is ~27 ppm slower than the on-board PWM clock, so the
ring is starved and the number of dropped samples equals the event count (no
hidden loss). On the old firmware this is **1.3 full-scale steps per second
(clicks)**; this version turns each into a repeated sample (~20 µs,
inaudible) - the one item of this change that simulation could not settle.

- **Doc-number consistency**: all 72 values quoted in this document were found
  in the corresponding script output (`audio_quality.py resp/compare/drift/`
  `mono/volume`, `pll_range.py bands/check/minstep`); no documented number is
  unreproducible.
