# upload.sh — push python/main.py to the Pico, working around the FM console.
#
# Why this is not a plain `mpremote cp`:
#   main.py boots into the interactive FM console, which sits in input()
#   and catches Ctrl-C by design.  mpremote needs the plain MicroPython
#   REPL to upload files, so `mpremote cp` fails with
#   "could not enter raw repl" (the console swallows the handshake).
#
# This script:
#   1. resolves the board's CDC port by its USB IDs (tools/pico_port.sh,
#      1209:fa50) so another ttyACM device - a PlutoSDR, an ST-Link, a
#      second Pico - cannot be picked by mistake;
#   2. opens that port, probes the REPL state by sending CR (Enter) and
#      watching for the prompt:
#        "fm> "  -> the FM console is up: send `exit` (retried) so it
#                   returns to the plain MicroPython REPL;
#        ">>> "  -> already at the plain REPL: nothing to do;
#      a leftover raw-REPL state (from a previous mpremote session) is
#      exited with Ctrl-B first;
#   3. uploads main.py with `mpremote connect <port> resume fs cp`
#      (resume = no soft reset, so the console does not grab the REPL again);
#   4. resets the board with machine.reset() so the new main.py runs.
#
# Works in all states: console up, plain REPL, raw REPL leftover, or no
# main.py yet (first boot).
#
# Usage: ./upload.sh [--port /dev/ttyACMx] [path-to-main.py]
#        FM_PORT=/dev/ttyACMx ./upload.sh
